# **Telecharm userbot**
A powerful and fast Telegram userbot written in Python 3.8 and based on Pyrogram async.
Currently in active WIP state, so feel free to contribute.

## **Starting up**
**_Ensure you have installed the latest version of Python before proceeding._**
1. Git clone the repo and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and open it.
3. Visit https://my.telegram.org/apps and get your own `api_id` and `api_hash`.
4. Edit `.env` file: fill in your `api_id`, `api_hash` and your phone number.
5. Run `app/main.py`.

## **Usage**
After logging in just send `.help` command to get the available commands list in **English** and `.help ru` for **Russian**.<br />Thanks for using **Telecharm** :)
