A powerful, fast and simple Telegram userbot written in Python 3.8 and based on Pyrogram 1.X. Currently in active WIP
state, so feel free to contribute.

## **Starting up**

**_Ensure you have installed the Python 3.7 or above before proceeding._**

1. Git clone the repo and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Visit https://my.telegram.org/apps and get your own `api_id` and `api_hash`.
3. Rename `.env.dist` to `.env` and open it.
4. Edit `.env` file: fill in your `api_id`, `api_hash`.
5. Run the userbot: `python3 app` or any convenient way of yours.

## **Usage**

After logging in just send `.help` command to get the available commands or share Telecharm in **English**
and `.help ru` for **Russian**.<br />Thanks for using **Telecharm** :)
